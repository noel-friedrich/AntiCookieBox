## About

This extension will delete an 'accept cookie' section of a page, by simply removing it from your screen
This plugin behaves similar to an ad blocker, but for 'Accept Cookies' Boxes. The plugin will automatically scan the pages you load and remove the boxes, without accepting any Cookie use!  
  
How does it work?  
Behind the scenes, Lucy is your internet-immune system. She's a detective and just really good at finding 'Accept Cookies' popups. She loves eating them :)  

Just keep surfing the web as usual, but without wasting precious time clicking away useless cookie boxes and giving random web-services access to your personal data.
